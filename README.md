# Teaser Specification

You are given a real-life example of a code, written in TypeScript, which is written in an unmaintainable way and needs refactoring.

The exercise is as follows:

1) Reverse-engineer what was the desired functionality of a `Teaser` class in `method.ts` file.
2) Refactor the class to the best of your ability.

**CAUTION! The class was written by inexperienced developer, and it's possible you encounter bugs in the functionality (it may not even run at first!). Please fix any bugs you encounter.**

Note: the code structure and the thinking behind it is more important than the functionality itself.
