# Teaser Specification

You are given a real-life example of a code, written in TypeScript, which is written in an unmaintainable way and needs refactoring.

The exercise is as follows:

1) Reverse-engineer what was the desired functionality of a `Teaser` class in `method.ts` file.
2) Refactor the class to the best of your ability.

**CAUTION! The class was written by inexperienced developer, and it's possible you encounter bugs in the functionality (it may not even run at first!). Please fix any bugs you encounter.**

### Expected result

The end result would be the refactored class which would improve maintainability and readability. The code structure and the thinking behind it is more important than the functionality itself, which would only count as extra points.

### FAQ

* How can I debug the code?

For help with debugging TypeScript with Visual Studio Code, please refer to the following documentation:
